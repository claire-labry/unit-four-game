# unit-four-game

This project is the Crystal Collector game! 

BEWARE! If you do not meet the random number, the Crystal Gremlins will steal all of YOUR crystals. 

If you figure out the number behind the crystal and match the random number given, your crystal are safe from the gremlins. Watch out! 

The project is useful because it teaches you about figuring out the numbers that the crystals hold and ensuring that your crystals are safe. 

You can get started with the project by creating a index.html and write up your words that you wanna say to help instruct to win against the gremlins. 

Then you add some SYLE to your page, make sure your STYLE repels the gremlins! 

Then you create some javascript to create functions to navigate and keep your crystals safe. 

If you need more help, feel free to reach out to the Crystal Master. They will guide you through the darkness. 

Claire maintains and contributes to the destruction of the gremlins.
